* Remove any residual dependency on verification stuff
* Replace old cruft by standard Haskell libraries
  * IOBuffering -> s/noBuffering/hSetBuffering stdout NoBuffering/ (using System.IO)
  * MyST -> Control.Monad.ST
  * LavaDir -> useless ?
  * LavaRandom -> System.Random
* Investigate Ref, which uses unsafePerformIO
* Use standard combinators instead of custom ones as much as possible
  (e.g. s/(->-)/(>=>)/)
* Use multi-parameter type classes + fundeps in Signal
* Tweak Netlist so it outputs the format we want
