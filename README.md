Li(sp)Monade (Simulisp) 0.2
============

A very basic processor simulated at the logic gate level, based on an
experimental Lisp machine architecture brought back from the dead, and
designed using copious amounts of Haskell.

This is actually a school project for a hardware architecture course
at Ecole Normale SupÃ©rieure.

Contents:
* Some tools to simulate synchronous digital circuits written in a
simple netlist language
* An emulator for the processor (in imperative-style OCaml)
* A high-level hardware description language embedded in Haskell,
  inspired by Lava
* A toolset to write the microcode
* An assembler (yet to come)


Installation
------------

### Requirements

- Haskell Platform >= 2013.2.0.0
- (For the emulator only) OCaml >= 4.00

### Building

We use Cabal as our build system.

    cd ./simulisp/haskell
    cabal configure
    cabal build

The binaries generated are:
- the simulator in `dist/build/simulator/simulator`
- a program to generate the netlist of the processor
  in `dist/build/generate-processor/generate-processor`

Simulator usage
---------------

To simulate juste one step:
`./simulator --input=var1:(val1)+,...,vari:(vali)+ <netlist file name>`

To simulate n steps by feeding n inputs to the program through a file:
`./simulator --finput=<input file name> <netlist file name>`

More information:
`./simulator --help`

### Structure of input files

    var ::= string                                                        
    val ::= binary number                                                 
                                                                          
    assign ::= var ':' number                                             
                                                                          
    line ::= assign                                                     
           | assign ',' line                                            
                                                                          
    file ::= line                                                        
           | line '\n' file                                              
                                                                          
Semantics:                                                     
- the nth line describes the inputs for the nth simulation step
- a line is a comma-separated sequence of assignments of the form
  `variable:value`

WARNING: All the required inputs of your Netlists must be described in
your input file.

### Structure of ROM files

A succession of lines, each of which is of the type

    <ID of the ROM chip in the netlist>:<contents in binary>
